## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to the project:

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please file an issue. When reporting a bug, please include the following:

- **Clear description** of the issue.
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue.
- The expected behavior versus what happened.
- The version of the project you are using.

Create a bug report [here](https://github.com/formsible/element/issues).

### Suggesting Features

We encourage you to suggest new features! Please describe:

- The feature or enhancement you're proposing.
- Why this feature would be useful.
- Any possible alternatives you've considered.

Create a feature request [here](https://github.com/formsible/element/issues).

### Submitting Pull Requests

We love receiving pull requests! If you plan to contribute code, here are some steps to follow:

1. **Fork the repo** and create your feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

2. **Make changes** in your forked repository. Follow the [Code Guidelines](#code-guidelines) to maintain code quality.
   
3. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add a brief description of your changes"
   ```

5. **Push your branch** to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

6. **Submit a pull request** to the `main` branch of the original repository. Reference any related issues in your PR description. Your pull request will be reviewed, and feedback may be provided.

## Code Guidelines

To maintain a clean and consistent codebase, please follow these guidelines.

### Coding Style

- **ESLint**: We use ESLint to enforce JavaScript style rules. Run `npm run lint` before committing your changes.
- **Prettier**: The code should be formatted using Prettier. Install and configure Prettier in your editor to auto-format code.

Some general style tips:
- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions.
- Use `PascalCase` for Vue components.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Prefer modern ES6+ syntax (e.g., arrow functions, destructuring, etc.).

### Commit Messages

Commit messages should be concise but descriptive. Use the following format for your commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

Example commit message types:
- **feat**: A new feature.
- **fix**: A bug fix.
- **docs**: Documentation updates.
- **style**: Code formatting, no logic change.
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.

Example:
```
feat(button): add loading spinner to submit button
```

---

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, ensure that all existing tests pass and that new features or fixes are covered by tests.

1. Run all tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

2. If you are fixing a bug or adding a feature, include unit or integration tests for it.

3. We use **Jest** for unit testing. You can find the test files in the `tests/` folder.

---

## Release Process

We use automated publishing via GitHub Actions. After merging pull requests into the `main` branch, our CI/CD pipeline will run tests and, if successful, publish the package to NPM.

You donâ€™t need to worry about publishing the package manually.

Feel free to reach out to the maintainers or fellow contributors in the following ways:

- **GitHub Discussions**: [formsible.com]
